This post will be about if we can show some data in other ways to **try** to 
tell more clearly the **Oh! *Foo!* is this rly happening?** story.

Time time ago an gif appears showing the change of the global temperatures
over time.

Well, some sites like http://gizmodo.com/ made a reference to this animation
as [one-of-the-most-convincing-climate-change-visualization](http://gizmodo.com/one-of-the-most-convincing-climate-change-visualization-1775743779).
Mmmm... ok! A kind of *click bait* IMHO but at least the title saids visualization :B. But for me the 
animation don't work **always**. I rembember a quote, sadly I don't rember the author, maybe/surely was
Alberto Cairo (If you know it please tell me who was):

> Animation force the user to compare what they see with what they remember (saw).

If you want it in Yoda's way:

Other thing I don't like so much about this spiral is there'are so much data 
overlaped at the end of animation hiding information about the speed of increment 
in the data.





## Data  & Packages

We'll use the data provide by [hrbrmstr](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr) in his 
[repo](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hadcrut).
Bob Rudis made a beautiful representation of the data via ggplot2 and D3 using a 
`geom_segment`/column range viz.

About the packages. Here we'll use a lot of `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr` for the data manipulation,
for the colors we'll use `viridis`, lastly I'll use [`highcharter`](jkunst.com/highcharter)
for charts 
  


```r
library("highcharter")
library("readr")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("lubridate")
library("purrr")
library("viridis")

options(
  highcharter.theme = hc_theme_darkunica(
    chart  = list(
      style = list(fontFamily = "Roboto Condensed"),
      backgroundColor = "#323331"
      ),
    yAxis = list(
      gridLineColor = "#B71C1C",
      labels = list(format = "{value} C", useHTML = TRUE)
    ),
    plotOptions = list(series = list(showInLegend = FALSE))
  )
)

df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrbrmstr/hadcrut/master/data/temps.csv")

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(year_mon),
         tmpstmp = datetime_to_timestamp(date),
         year = year(date),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         color_m = colorize(median, viridis(10, option = "B")),
         color_m = hex_to_rgba(color_m, 0.65))

dfcolyrs <- df %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(median = median(median)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(color_y = colorize(median, viridis(10, option = "B")),
         color_y = hex_to_rgba(color_y, 0.65)) %>% 
  select(-median)

df <- left_join(df, dfcolyrs, by = "year")
```


The data is ready, let's go.

## Spiral

First of all let's try to replicate the chart/gif/animation that's reason
to write this post. Here we'll construtct a `list` of series to use 
with `hc_add_series_list` function.



```r
lsseries <- df %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  do(
    data = .$median,
    color = first(.$color_y)) %>% 
  mutate(name = year) %>% 
  list.parse3()

hc1 <- highchart() %>% 
  hc_chart(polar = TRUE) %>% 
  hc_plotOptions(
    series = list(
      marker = list(enabled = FALSE),
      animation = TRUE,
      pointIntervalUnit = "month")
    ) %>%
  hc_legend(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_xAxis(type = "datetime", min = 0, max = 365 * 24 * 36e5,
           labels = list(format = "{value:%B}")) %>%
  hc_tooltip(headerFormat = "{point.key}",
             xDateFormat = "%B",
             pointFormat = " {series.name}: {point.y}") %>% 
  hc_add_series_list(lsseries)

hc1
```

Ok! without the animation componet this don't work so much.

If we want replicate the animation part we can hide all the series 
using transparency.


```r
lsseries2 <- df %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  do(
    data = .$median,
    color = "transparent",
    enableMouseTracking = FALSE,
    color2 = first(.$color_y)) %>% 
  mutate(name = year) %>% 
  list.parse3()
```


Then using a little of javascript we can color each series 
one by one with the real color.



```r
hc11 <- highchart() %>% 
  hc_chart(polar = TRUE) %>% 
  hc_plotOptions(series = list(
    marker = list(enabled = FALSE),
    animation = TRUE,
    pointIntervalUnit = "month")) %>%
  hc_legend(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Animated Spiral") %>% 
  hc_xAxis(type = "datetime", min = 0, max = 365 * 24 * 36e5,
           labels = list(format = "{value:%B}")) %>%
  hc_tooltip(headerFormat = "{point.key}", xDateFormat = "%B",
             pointFormat = " {series.name}: {point.y}") %>% 
  hc_add_series_list(lsseries2) %>% 
  hc_chart(
    events = list(
      load = JS("

function() {
  console.log('ready');
  var duration = 16 * 1000
  var delta = duration/this.series.length;
  var delay = 2000;

  this.series.map(function(e){
    setTimeout(function() {
      e.update({color: e.options.color2, enableMouseTracking: true});
      e.chart.setTitle({text: e.name})
    }, delay)
    delay = delay + delta;
  });

}
                ")
    )
  )
```


And *voila*.



```r
hc11
```

You can open the chart in a new window to see the animation effect.

## Sesonalplot

We need polar coords here? I don't know so let's back 
to the euclidean space and see what happened



```r
hc2 <- hc1 %>% 
  hc_chart(polar = FALSE, type = "spline") %>% 
  hc_xAxis(max = (365 - 1) * 24 * 36e5) %>% 
  hc_yAxis(tickPositions = c(-1.5, 0, 1.5, 2))

hc2
```

<iframe src="/htmlwidgets/case-study-animation-and-others-vizs/highchart_jzqlgfd.html"></iframe> <a href="/htmlwidgets/case-study-animation-and-others-vizs/highchart_jzqlgfd.html" target="_blank">open</a>


**Nom!** A nice colored spaghettis. Not so much clear what happened
across the years. 


## Heatmap

Here we put the years in xAxis and month in yAxis:



```r
m <- df %>% 
  select(year, month, median) %>% 
  spread(year, median) %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  as.matrix() 

rownames(m) <- month.abb

hc3 <- hchart(m) %>% 
  hc_colorAxis(
    stops = color_stops(10, viridis(10, option = "B")),
    min = -1, max = 1
    ) %>% 
  hc_yAxis(
    title = list(text = NULL),
    tickPositions = FALSE,
    labels = list(format = "{value}", useHTML = TRUE)
    )

hc3
```

With the color scale used is not that clear the impact 
about the incremet. We can see the series have and increase 
but with colors is not so easy to quantify that change.


## Line / Time Series

Let's try now the most simply chart. And let's represent
the data as a time series.



```r
dsts <- df %>% 
  mutate(name = paste(decade, month)) %>% 
  select(x = tmpstmp, y = median, name)

hc4 <- highchart() %>% 
  hc_xAxis(type = "datetime") %>%
  hc_yAxis(tickPositions = c(-1.5, 0, 1.5, 2)) %>% 
  hc_add_series_df(dsts, name = "Global Temperature",
                   type = "line", color = hex_to_rgba(viridis(10, option = "B")[7]),
                   lineWidth = 1,
                   states = list(hover = list(lineWidth = 1)),
                   shadow = FALSE) 
hc4
```

maybe it's so simple. What do you think?

## Columrange

Finally let's add the information about the confidence interval and
add the media information using a color same as 
[hrbrmstr](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr) did.

With highcharter it's easy. Just define the dataframe with `x`,
`low`, `high` and `color` and add it to a `highchart` object 
with the `hc_add_series_df` function.



```r
dscr <- df %>% 
  mutate(name = paste(decade, month)) %>% 
  select(x = tmpstmp, low = lower, high = upper, name, color = color_m)

hc5 <- highchart() %>% 
  hc_yAxis(tickPositions = c(-2, 0, 1.5, 2)) %>% 
  hc_xAxis(type = "datetime") %>%
  hc_add_series_df(dscr, name = "Global Temperature",
                   type = "columnrange")

hc5
```

<iframe src="/htmlwidgets/case-study-animation-and-others-vizs/highchart_duqyorn.html"></iframe> <a href="/htmlwidgets/case-study-animation-and-others-vizs/highchart_duqyorn.html" target="_blank">open</a>


(IMHO) This is a really way to show what we want to say:

* Via a time series chart it's wasy compare the past with the 
actual period of time.
* The color, in particular the last *yellowish* part, add importance and guide our
eyes to that part of the chart before to start to compare.

Do you have other ways to represent this data?
